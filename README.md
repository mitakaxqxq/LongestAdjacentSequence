# LongestAdjacentSequence

### How to start

Run ```python ./myprogram.py``` and add the names of the tests you want to run. You can only run from 1 to 4 tests at a time.

Example:

```python ./myprogram.py test_1``` will run with only 1 test

```python ./myprogram.py test_1 test_2 test_3 test_4``` will run with 4 tests

All of the tests you run should be included in the folder ```tests```
